## Maple.Software is Crashing! :KaedeChanAngry: 

The most common result of crashing during injection & gameplay may be due to the following:

- Windows Defender Virus & Threat Protection not being entirely disabled without the use of Defender Control. This means going into the settings listed "Virus & Threat Protection", and disabling all of the settings in that section.
 - Extra Note: Anti-Virus's like Malwarebytes, BitDefender, and Kaspersky have to be **fully** paused for Maple.Software to work without instabilities.

- Overlays like Discord, Steam, Overwolf, RivaTuner (MSI Afterburner overlay), Xbox Game Bar, Geforce Experience overlay causes issues with Maple.Software and may cause instabilities.
 - Extra Note: Third-Party applications like [Gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory) may also cause instabilities.

- Game Anti-Cheats such as Vanguard also may cause instabilities with Maple.Software please be sure to disable/exit the programs before injecting Maple.Software.

- An unstable VPN may also cause instabilities with Maple.Software, if Maple.Software detects that the connection has been severred it will automatically close osu. This is a security measure on our part.

- Custom windows installations may also cause instabilities with Maple. (e.g, - GHOST SPECTRE)

- Maple.Software may also be oudated, you may check the current status of Maple at the following:

## Infinite loading and/or slow injection! :KaedeChanConfused: 

The most common result of infinite loading and/or slow injection may be due to the following:

- Your current Network (internet) is slow which causes Maple.Software to inject slower this also goes for a slow CPU.
 - Extra Note: A VPN may also be the cause if it is unstable and/or slow.

- Your Anti-Virus may be tampering with Maple.Software's injection process, please be sure to disable all Anti-Virus applications.
 - Extra Note: You may also refer to the "Maple.Software is Crashing! :KaedeChanAngry: " section for a solution regarding this.
